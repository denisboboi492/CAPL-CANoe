This project involves the develpment of a smart wiper system, consisting of 3 ECUs (Electronic Control Unit): Main ECU, Humidity Sensor ECU and Wiper Control ECU.

The humidity sensor is going to return random values between 0 and 40 with a 7 second cycle. The below table show the correlation between the sensor value and the rain intensity.
| Sensor value | Rain intensity |
| ------------ | -------------- |
|       0-7    |      no ra     |
|    8-15      |     low        |
|   16-31      |     medium     |
|   32-40      |      high      |

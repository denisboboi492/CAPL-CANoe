The focus of this project is to create a panel using the Python programming language to control a power supply via USB. I worked with PyQt5 for the user interface: buttons, labels, drop-down list, and with pyvisa for opening, closing and communicating over USB.

The commands for controlling the power supply were taken from the product datasheet.

Bellow you can preview the panel:

The panel contains buttons for connecting to a specific resource, for turning on and off the power supply, for checking the status (on/off,volts,amps) of the power supply and for setting custom values for volts.

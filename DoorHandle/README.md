The goal of this project is to develop a system that enables remote control of a door handle, as visually represented by an Arduino's built-in LED. This system will utilize a panel created in Canoe, with code written in CAPL, and will be integrated with an Arduino device. This can be used to create automated test cases based on specific requirements.

The panel contains buttons for controlling COM port, simple lock-unlock, touch lock-unlock and includes input fields for port number and touch duration. Check the panel bellow:
